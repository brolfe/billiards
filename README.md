This is a little physics simulation page.

## Installation

    npm install
    bower install
    grunt
    grunt http-server

## To Do

1. Style it!
    1. circles should be round...shouldn't they?
    1. Make it responsive!
1. Add UI controlls
    1. Start/stop should toggle
    1. slider for adjusting num of circles
1. Momentum and size: circles should take a size argument which would also be their mass.
1. Brownian motion "external force".
1. Framework-ize it?
    1. Have an "app state" model. Make the field a view and controls update/reflect that app-state model (or scope or whatever).
    1. Angular with angular-ui?
