# Billiards

This is a little physics simulation page. Still got a long way to go.

## Installation

    npm install
    bower install
    grunt
    grunt http-server

## To Do

1. Make the "field" a jquery ui widget.
1. New up the circles, new up the field, add the circles to the field
1. circles should take a size argument which would also be their mass.
1. A "random" acceleration option would make neat, Brownian motion simulations.
1. circles should have an "applyExternalForce" method to update the acceleration members. This method could even take a function as an argument.
